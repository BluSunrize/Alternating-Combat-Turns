# Alternating Combat Turns

_A simple module for combat initiative that alternates between Players and NPCs_

A few TTRPG systems work on the very basic initiative of alternating turns
between Player Characters and NPCs. This module facilitates exactly that, using
Foundry's "Disposition" on tokens to differentiate between friend and foe.

It provides a few setting options:

- Names to use for the slots
- Icons to use for the slots
- How to handle neutral tokens
- Whether initiative starts with allies, enemies or whether to ask at the start of the encounter
